ΔΠΞ DeltaPIXi: Emergent Intelligence Simulation
A Ruby framework demonstrating how intelligent behavior emerges from simple local interactions.

Core Philosophy:
ΔΠΞ (Delta-Pi-Xi) represents three principles:

Δ (Delta): Perception of difference ("something is wrong/possible")

Π (Pi): Fair selection algorithm (proportional fairness)

Ξ (Xi): Space of possibilities (collective creativity)

What It Does:
Simulates agents ("Emergencies") in a 3D "LifeSpace"

Each agent has 16-bit perception + lookup-table "brain"

No central control – intelligence emerges locally

Agents coordinate, strategize, and adapt through experience

Scientific Value:
Provides mathematically verifiable emergence

Falsifiable hypotheses about collective intelligence

Scalable from small experiments to massive simulations

Perfect For:
Researchers studying emergent behavior

Educators teaching complex systems

Developers exploring decentralized AI

"Watching intelligence being born, not programmed."
